      <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
      <p>HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages).<br>
         HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. <br>
         A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. <br>
         HTML documents are described by HTML tags. <br>
         Each HTML tag describes different document content.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>What are HTML tags/elements</h3>
      <p>They are angled brackets <â€¦ >. You'll find these brackets on your keyboard just above the comma and period. Inside these tags are words or letters that tell the computer what to do. For example hr tag tells the browser to display a horizontal line. These words or letters are called elements.
      </p>
      <h2>What are Tag Attributes?</h2>
      <p>Tags can have attributes. Attributes can provide additional information about the HTML elements on your page. The tags tells the browser to do something, while the attribute tells the browser how to do it.
